# BingoFire requirements

Create a script that displays the series from 1 to 50.
However, there should be special conditions implemented.
If a number contains the digit 7, it should display "Bingo" in place of the number.
Where a number ends in 0, it should output "Fire".
If a number meets both conditions (i.e., it contains the digit 7 and ends with 0), it should print "BingoFire".
